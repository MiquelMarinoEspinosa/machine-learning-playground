Linear regression
    - BMW sales data (2010-2024).csv
        - It might be that sales and price are incompatible
            - may be when predicting one the other should be discarded

Logistic regression
    - Diabetes_and_LifeStyle_Dataset.csv
        - Take care about diabetes_stage column, it might contaminate the data set
        - Also diabetes_risk_score column
        - Some feature engineering can be applied to some columns, or even remove some columns since they are inferred in other columns
            - cholesterol_total, hdl_cholesterol, ldl_cholesterol -> no strict correlation
            - systolic_bp, diastolic_bp, heart_rate -> no strict correlation
