Next steps
- One hot encoding with scikitlearn
    -------> add feature names as one hot encoded columns prefix just like panda
- Feature scaling with pandas and scikit learn
- Use pipelines for preprocessing
    - Cat encoding
    - Scale
- Feature analysis and enginiering
    - Analyse correlation
- Drop not useful features
