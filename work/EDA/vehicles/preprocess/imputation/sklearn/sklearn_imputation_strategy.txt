- Year -> 
    SimpleImputer -> most frequent or median same result 2013. Do not use mean and treat it in the future as categorical variable?
                    -> use the median better. 50% of the values |=D
                        -> quantile? to get any of the other median values or the min or the max? =-|:\/
    KNNImputer -> 5 and uniform -> 2011 (it takes some time and CPU)
                  3 and uniform -> 2011 (it takes some time and CPU)
                  2,3,5,10 and distance -> 2011 (it taks some time and CPU) does not convince me at all :/
    Iterative imputer -> 2018 default most freaquent values and quick enough without using a lot of resources like pandas :D
                         constant value also works well
                         mean 2011 also good performance
                         median 2013 also good performance, though there is not a lot of difference with simple imputer and pandas imputation
- Manufacturer ->
    SimpleImputer most frequent -> ford
    SimpleImputer constant -> other -> there is not other in this case. Therefore may better consider most frequent
    KNNImputation -> as far as I know it does not work for categorical variables
    IterativeImputer -> Also not valid for categorical variables, there is a pull request proposal https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/31479
- Fuel ->
    SimpleImputer most frequent -> gas
    SimpleImputer constant -> other

- Odometer -> SimpleImputer

                - mean -> 97746 similar to median
                - median
                - constant with 0
                - most frequent -> 
- Title status -> bfill, ffill and mode have similar output. But the most appropriate option is use the 'missing' value
- Transmition -> bfill, ffill and mode have similar output. But the most appropriate option is use the 'other' value
- Transmition -> bfill, ffill and mode have similar output. But the most appropriate option is use the 'other' value
