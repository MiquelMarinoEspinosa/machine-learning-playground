- Year -> 
    SimpleImputer -> most frequent or median same result 2013. Do not use mean and treat it in the future as categorical variable?
- Manufacturer -> bfill, ffill or mode
- Model -> bfill, ffill or mode
******************** Analyze better the model, the high cardinality of the column is suspicious amd it might be removed **********
     - Model removed for high cardinality and very difficult to clean
- Fuel -> bfill, ffill, mode -> 'gas' is the most used value for bfill and ffill
                             -> 'other' value can be also condired
- Odometer -> best strategy 'linear interpolate'
- Title status -> bfill, ffill and mode have similar output. But the most appropriate option is use the 'missing' value
- Transmition -> bfill, ffill and mode have similar output. But the most appropriate option is use the 'other' value
- Transmition -> bfill, ffill and mode have similar output. But the most appropriate option is use the 'other' value
